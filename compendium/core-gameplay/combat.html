id="Combat">Combat</h1><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Updated ideas:</p></div><div class="el-ul"><ul>
<li data-line="0" dir="auto">Damage always hits, but the effect may be mitigated</li>
<li data-line="1" dir="auto">Spell effects will have to overcome the enemies resistance, spells can be stacked to weaken this</li>
<li data-line="2" dir="auto">Armor negates damage up to its value per round,  armor penetration allows a portion of that armor to be ignored. Flanking attacks will reduce deal double damage to armor. e.g.: If a creature has 15 armor and an attack was rolled for 22 damage -- reduce the attack by 7 instead of 15</li>
<li data-line="3" dir="auto">Resistances function the same as armor, but for specific damage types. Resistances are not reduced by flanking</li>
</ul></div><div class="el-h5 heading-wrapper"><h5 data-heading="Key Terms:" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Key_Terms:"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Key Terms:</h5><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-ul"><ul>
<li data-line="0" dir="auto"><em>Queue</em> - Each player and the DM has a Queue which is where they play their Action, Reaction, Triggered Strategy, and Consumable Cards. Cards will be cleared from the Queue at the end of the combat round unless otherwise specified.</li>
<li data-line="1" dir="auto"><em>Reserve</em> - Each player and DM has a Reserve where persistent cards are played, such as Buffs / Debuffs, Strategy and Equipment Cards. Reserve Cards stay in play until their effects have expired or are moved to the Field.</li>
<li data-line="2" dir="auto"><em>Pool</em> - Pool represents the cards that players and the DM have in their hands. The standard Pool size is 5, and you will draw up to this number at the beginning of every combat round.</li>
<li data-line="3" dir="auto"><em>Discard Pile</em> - Most cards will go to the discard pile after their effect has expired unless otherwise specified. The discard pile will be shuffled when resetting your Deck.</li>
<li data-line="4" dir="auto"><em>Out of Play</em> - Some cards will have limited uses per Encounter, Rest, or Day. These cards are put Out of Play when their effects have expired. They can be shuffled back into the Deck when their cooldown has finished.</li>
<li data-line="5" dir="auto"><em>Deck</em> - Players and DM's have a Deck that holds all their available cards. When players reach the end of the deck, they will shuffle the Discard pile to reset it and gain 1 point of Exhaustion. For every two points of exhaustion, your Pool will be reduced by 1.</li>
<li data-line="6" dir="auto"><em>Field</em> - The field is the combat grid where player and enemy character tokens interact. The field is made up of a grid or hexagon tile pattern where each tile represents 5ft. Movement is always measured as 5ft, even when moving diagonally. When dealing with elevation during combat, to simplify math the distance is calculated as Horizontal Distance + 1/2 Vertical distance. Though it is recommended to avoid using this excessively, try to only emphasize this when vertically is a key part of the encounter.</li>
<li data-line="7" dir="auto"><em>Action Points</em> - Action Points are the core resource that allow players and enemies to use abilities and make attacks. Most classes have a base of 3 Action Points, these reset at the beginning of the Combat Round unless specified by an effect.</li>
<li data-line="8" dir="auto"><em>Combat Round</em> - The Combat Round is comprised of 2 phases: Player Turns and Enemy Turns. There is no set turn order between players, and they can plan out their moves strategically if necessary.</li>
<li data-line="9" dir="auto"><em>Reactions</em> - Players and most enemies will have access to Reactions that have certain triggers. These can be played directly from the player's Pool if available.</li>
</ul></div></div></div><div class="el-h5 heading-wrapper"><h5 data-heading="Combat:" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Combat:"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Combat:</h5><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Combat is what truly separates this from other TTRPG's, as it is centered around a deck building mechanic. Somewhat inspired by games like Slay the Spire, combat has not specific turn order and players can collaborate to enhance each others abilities. There is only two types of combat starts: Player Priority and Enemy Priority, this simply decides whether the players get round first or if the enemy does. This will be determined by the circumstances that lead to combat, and the players choices in how they approach dangerous situations. In combat, players will face three type of enemies: Monsters, Minions, and Bosses.</p></div><div class="el-ul"><ul>
<li data-line="0" dir="auto"><em>Monsters:</em>  Any threat can be a monster, not only 'monstrous' creatures, the term is to simply codify the capabilities of an enemy. A Monster is a threatening entity that has a small card pool of abilities that will be added to the DM's hand during combat. They will also have innate abilities and equipment similar to Player Characters.</li>
<li data-line="1" dir="auto"><em>Minions:</em> Lesser threats that are represented by a single card. Often part of a Monster or Boss's card pool. Their attacks and defence will be stated on the card.</li>
<li data-line="2" dir="auto"><em>Bosses:</em> Bosses are the big bad enemies that your hero's will aspire to defeat. Offering a much greater challenge and reward than Monsters, a Boss may have a full deck of cards and be accompanied by Monsters and Minions.</li>
</ul></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">At the beginning of the combat, players will draw 5 cards from their deck and if they have priority will play the first combat round. Each player may expend all their action points each turn, and action points are reset on each combat round. Cards will provided a detailed explanation of their effect and damage / defensive value. Some of these effects will be based on the state of combat, the cards available or combinations with other effects.</p></div><div class="el-ul"><ul>
<li data-line="0" dir="auto"><div class="list-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div><em>Resolving Damage:</em> Compare the damage being dealt to the Defence rating of the enemy, the enemy then takes damage equal the amount that exceeds this defence rating. Some enemies may have resistances or immunities to certain damage types.
<ul>
<li data-line="1" dir="auto"><em>Resistances</em> are added to the enemies Defence rating when taking damage from the associated type. Most attacks will only inflict a single damage type.</li>
<li data-line="2" dir="auto"><em>Immunities</em> as the name imply mean that the enemy will not take any damage from this damage type unless an effect otherwise states.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li data-line="3" dir="auto">Stronger Monster's and Bosses can react with defensive abilities that may reduce or negate incoming damage. They will usually have a limited number of reactions available per turn. Players will be able to see these values and factor them into their strategy.</li>
</ul></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Once players have resolved their damage, the enemy will take their turn and repeat the damage resolution process against the players. Each player will have 1 reaction available to use a Defensive Card or Innate Ability. Some equipment may offer additional effects that can be used to bolster Defence further.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A cheat sheet for this will be provided later.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong><em>Running Combat:</em></strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The goal of combat, like any TTRPG is to continue the narrative and allow opportunities for players to roleplay their characters. As the DM you should encourage your players to describe their actions and keep their dialogue in character. As such, run combat with a goal in mind - perhaps a sub goal that must be achieved to ensure victory or save a friendly NPC. Play the enemies as real living beings with their own goals, intentions, and will to live.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><em>Examples:</em></p></div><div class="el-ul"><ul>
<li data-line="0" dir="auto">A random encounter with a set of bandits will not likely fight to the last man and may attempt to flee when they see things are not going their way. They may plead for mercy or attempt to bribe the players. Your goal is to prevent combat from becoming a slog and detracting from the story telling. </li>
<li data-line="1" dir="auto">A Boss may have been in fact delaying the players while his master plan unfolds in the background.</li>
<li data-line="2" dir="auto">Players are fighting in a burning building and must either defeat the enemies or escape before the building collapses. Use timers or limited combat rounds to create time pressure.</li>
</ul></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong><em>Combat Difficulty:</em></strong> </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Combat Difficulty is often one of the most challenging parts of any TTRPG. Finding the balance between creating a sense of danger and outright lethal encounters can be difficult. It may be worth consulting your players for how difficult they want the game to be, and how dire the consequences of failure are.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><em>Here are some suggestions for managing difficulty:</em></p></div><div class="el-ul"><ul>
<li data-line="0" dir="auto">Adapt to your players abilities - it's often best to start with a lower difficulty and scale it up as your players start to master their class. If they are crushing every combat with ease, this should be an obvious sign that your difficulty is too low -- whereas if they're struggling to survive every single combat then you may want to pull back a bit.</li>
<li data-line="1" dir="auto">Dynamic Combat Scaling: While enemies may have a set deck and set of abilities, you as the DM can choose how aggressively to play them. If a combat is clearly getting out of hand for the players, you can hold back abilities as you see fit, and even reduce enemies HP if necessary. Your goal should not be TPK's every combat.</li>
<li data-line="2" dir="auto">Enemies combat potency should be somewhat equivalent to their narrative placement. A random bandit might be a threat early on, but should stand no chance against a geared and levelled party. These distinctions should also be visible to players, allowing them to approach dangerous situations differently depending on the level of threat. In some cases, avoiding combat will be the best option.</li>
<li data-line="3" dir="auto">Failing forward - Occasionally your party will falter in combat, whether they picked a fight too difficult or simply misplayed their cards. You as the DM should be prepared to offer alternative outcomes to combat that do not result in a party wipe. Bandits may be willing to spare lives for gold, it may be possible to flee from a creature, offering service or fealty to a enemy Boss may allow them to keep their lives (If they so choose). This does not mean removing the possibility of character death, but should be used as a means to continue the narrative.</li>
</ul></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong><em>Player Deaths &amp; Party Wipes:</em></strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"> How you deal with player deaths and party wipes is entirely up to you as a DM. Will they be saved at the last moment by deus ex machina, or will their spirits be sent to a shadow realm? Will a players body be put in stasis until the possibility of resurrection? Or will your world be one of more mundane realities, and the dead stay dead. This should be part of your world building, and be planned for in the case of player deaths. Certainly removing the possibility of player death is not advisable, as it takes the danger out of the world -- but you don't want to torpedo your own campaign. Here are some ways you can handle character death:</p></div><div class="el-ul"><ul>
<li data-line="0" dir="auto">Offer the player a low penalty reroll, perhaps he can start at the same level but loses his equipment. Or he must complete a redemption quest to prove himself worth of joining the party.</li>
<li data-line="1" dir="auto">If the player is heavily attached to that character, you can offer them a temporary side role while they attempt to resurrect their character.</li>
<li data-line="2" dir="auto">On a party wipe, you could have them re-roll as a group of competing adventurers around the same level / equipment. </li>
<li data-line="3" dir="auto">Make the players fight their way out of a shadow / death realm and reclaim their physical forms.</li>
</ul></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Ultimately it's up to you and your players, so don't be afraid to consult them out of game. At the end of the day, they are here to be part of exploring the world and advancing YOUR story. So give them the tools they need to do so while getting maximum enjoyment out of being there. Some players enjoy the ruthless dangers of a lethal world, while others are more interested in the story telling and the ability to roleplay the ever victorious hero.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong><em>Advanced Combat Concepts:</em></strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Limited Round Combats:</strong><br>
Giving the players a limited number of combat rounds to resolve an encounter can create a more interesting challenge. This could be imposed by a looming danger or the necessity to achieve a tertiary goal. Be sure to consider what happens when the time runs out, what outcomes are you okay with risking if they fail?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><em>Example:</em><br>
The big bad guy has begun a summoning ritual that will take 10 rounds to complete. If the players do not defeat him in 10 rounds they will find themselves in a much more dire situation.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Combat Puzzles</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A combat puzzle forces the players to attempt to achieve their desired outcome in a combat round by managing and collaborating with their fellow players. Some encounters could be a set of these puzzles, and can be used to great effect when in a particularly lethal situation. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><em>Example:</em><br>
The players are fighting against a cult who's God is empowered by human sacrifice. Each round the players must attempt to stop as many of the cultists as possible from reaching the sacrificial altar that consumes their souls. After 3 rounds, the God will ascend and will have additional health for each cultist consumed. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Mitigating Factors</strong><br>
You can give the players the opportunity to reduce the danger of an encounter, this can be done through strategic planning, assassinating leaders or simply poisoning the stew. This rewards players for approaching combat with a more pre meditated mindset.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><em>Examples:</em><br>
<em>Example 1</em> - The players find out that the corrupt guard Captain is planning to ambush them and arrest them unlawfully. They also find out that his lieutenants are somewhat morally ambivalent towards the idea, and are possibly even opposed to it yet simply outranked. The players can attempt to avoid the ambush altogether, come in better prepared -- or attempt to sway the lieutenants into opposing the Captain in secret. This could create a scenario when they intentionally walk into the ambush and are able to turn it around and expose the treachery of the Captain.  </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><em>Example 2</em> - The players are planning to attack a vampire lord, and it is revealed that this lord draws his power from the souls of other vampires he's managed to enslave. These souls are being guarded at different locations throughout the world and could be destroyed to reduce the vampire lords power.</p></div><div class="mod-footer mod-ui"></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sidebar-right sidebar"><div class="sidebar-handle"></div><div class="sidebar-topbar"><div class="topbar-content"></div><div class="clickable-icon sidebar-collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="3" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon"><path d="M21 3H3C1.89543 3 1 3.89543 1 5V19C1 20.1046 1.89543 21 3 21H21C22.1046 21 23 20.1046 23 19V5C23 3.89543 22.1046 3 21 3Z"></path><path d="M10 4V20"></path><path d="M4 7H7"></path><path d="M4 10H7"></path><path d="M4 13H7"></path></svg></div></div><div class="sidebar-content"></div><script defer="">let rs = document.querySelector(".sidebar-right"); rs.classList.add("is-collapsed"); if (window.innerWidth > 768) rs.classList.remove("is-collapsed"); rs.style.setProperty("--sidebar-width", localStorage.getItem("sidebar-right-width"));</script></div></div></body></html>
