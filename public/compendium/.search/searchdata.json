Directly increases <em>attack power</em> and may be required to equip certain Great Weapons.  <em>Dexterity</em> - determines the characters physical agility and reaction time. Can increase <em>attack power</em> with finesse weapons and critical strike chance.  <em>Intellect</em> - determines the players capability for wielding the raw forces of magic. Increases <em>spell power</em> and may be required to cast more powerful spells.  <em>Faith</em> - determines the strength of the players connection to divine beings. Increases <em>spell power</em> for faith based casters and allows characters to bind themself to more powerful beings.  <em>Stamina</em> - determines physical fitness and resilience to enemy attacks. Increases base health points, movement speed and may be required to wear heavier armor types.   <em>Charisma</em> - determines the players ability to influence other through deception, performance and persuasion. Also also increases spell power in healing magics and bolstering magics.   <strong>Values:</strong>  Each class has a modifier for how efficiently they use certain attributes. Simply multiply the attribute by this modifier to get your Secondary Attributes. Value's are always rounded up.  <em>Example(s):</em>  The Elementalist class gains spell power from Intellect, with a class modifier of '.2'. So if the Elementalist has 15 Intellect, their spell power value will be 3.   The Weapon's Master class has a base modifier of '.2' for Stamina, but with the Sturdy feature this is increased to '.3'. So if the Weapon's Master has 12 Stamina, they will receive 4 HP per level.   <strong>Secondary Attributes:</strong> Secondary Attributes values are mostly inherited from Primary Attributes, but can be gained from certain equipment, consumables and spells.  <em>Attack Power</em> - The primary damage dealing attribute for physical damage dealers. The value determines the amount of dice rolled when dealing damage. The Damage Dice is determines by Class and equipment. Some attacks may specify a multiple of base attack power, such as half or double. Multiply the number of dice by this value and round up if necessary.  <em>Example:</em> A Rogue with 11 Dexterity has 2 Attack Power, and is wielding a D6 Dagger. Therefore when an attack uses the Rogue's Attack Power, it would be rolled as 2D6.    <em>Spell Power</em> - The primary damage dealing attribute for spell casters. Functions in the same manner as Attack Power, though the damage Dice varies based on the caster. <em>Example:</em> Warlocks Damage Dice is determined by the power of their Patron, our Level 2 Warlock is currently using a Lesser Hellfire Demon with a D8 Dice. With 10 Intellect, and a Spell Power of 2, the Spell Power roll would be 2D8.  <em>Hit Points</em> - Hit points represent your characters physical and mental well being. Your character becomes <em>Unconscious</em> and gains the <em>Dying</em> trait when this value hits 0. Hit points are calculated by adding your modified Stamina value to your classes base HP. <em>Example:</em> A Druid with a base HP of 11, has 10 Stamina with a class modifier of '.3'. So at level 3 the Druid would have 23 HP.  <em>Critical Strike</em> - Critical Strike determines the chance of achieving a Critical Strike on an attack. Not all attacks or classes are capable of Critical Strikes. The value of this attribute is range that has to be rolled to achieve a Critical Strike. <em>Example:</em> A Rogue has a Critical Strike value of 7, so when rolling the D100 they need to roll a 93 or higher.   <em>Defence Rating</em> - Determines the number of Defence Dice rolled when called on by a Defensive Action. Works similarly to Attack Power and Spell Power. <em>Example:</em> A Range has a Defence Rating of 3 and is wearing Leather Armour with a D4 rating. When taking damage they would roll 3D4 to mitigate incoming damage.  <strong>Tertiary Attributes</strong> Tertiary Attributes are additional attributes most often gained from specialized equipment and class Features. These are highly limited but very powerful effects.  <em>Armour Penetration</em> - Bypass enemy armour, negating Defence Rating equal to the attribute value.  <em>Hardened</em> - Your hardened exterior reduces the Attack Power of incoming attacks, negating the value equal to the attribute rating.  <em>Spell Penetration</em> - Bypass enemy Resistances, negating Resistance to the associated damage type by the value of the attribute.  <em>Resistant</em> - You are resistant to the specified damage type, reduce Spell Power on spells of this damage type by the value of the attribute.  <strong>Skills</strong>  Skills are Innate Abilities that players can use to overcome various challenges in the world. These are determined by Base Attributes, Features and player choices.  - <em>Athletics</em> (Strength) - Overcoming feats of physical strength such as a wrestling, lifting heavy objects and jumping. - <em>Acrobatics</em> (Dexterity) - Overcoming feats of agility and quick reaction such as a navigating traps, dodging threats, and acrobatics. - <em>Persuasion</em> (Charisma) - The character's ability to persuade the minds of other, can be used in business negotiations, interrogations and making allies. - <em>Arcana</em> (Intelligence) - Used to gain understanding and overcoming challenges pertaining to magic. This could be magic puzzles, powerful objects, and determining enemy vulnerabilities. - <em>Deception</em> (Charisma) - The character's ability to deceive others, such as lying about their intentions, misdirecting enemies and exaggerating. - <em>Nature</em> (Faith) - The characters knowledge and affinity for nature and animals. Used to interact with animals, identify reagents and determine the vulnerabilities of beasts.  - <em>Intimidation</em> (Charisma, Strength) - Used to convince others to do your bidding through fear. Can be used in interrogations, deterring enemies and haggling. - <em>Religion</em> (Faith) - Used to recall knowledge and overcome challenges pertaining to religion and the occult. This could be solving Faith based puzzles, communing with divine beings or strengthening extraplanar bonds. - <em>Sleight of Hand</em> (Dexterity)  - The characters ability to use their quick hands and dexterous cunning to overcome more illicit challenges. This includes lockpicking, theft, swapping objects and breaking and entering. - <em>Survival</em> (Faith, Intelligence)- The characters knowledge and ability to navigate the wilds and sense danger. This can be used to detect traps, track enemies and look for the signs of an ambush. - <em>Stealth</em> (Dexterity) - The characters ability to conceal themselves in the shadows and avoid enemy detection.

Somewhat inspired by games like Slay the Spire, combat has not specific turn order and players can collaborate to enhance each others abilities. There is only two types of combat starts: Player Priority and Enemy Priority, this simply decides whether the players get round first or if the enemy does. This will be determined by the circumstances that lead to combat, and the players choices in how they approach dangerous situations. In combat, players will face three type of enemies: Monsters, Minions, and Bosses.  - <em>Monsters:</em>  Any threat can be a monster, not only 'monstrous' creatures, the term is to simply codify the capabilities of an enemy. A Monster is a threatening entity that has a small card pool of abilities that will be added to the DM's hand during combat. They will also have innate abilities and equipment similar to Player Characters. - <em>Minions:</em> Lesser threats that are represented by a single card. Often part of a Monster or Boss's card pool. Their attacks and defence will be stated on the card. - <em>Bosses:</em> Bosses are the big bad enemies that your hero's will aspire to defeat. Offering a much greater challenge and reward than Monsters, a Boss may have a full deck of cards and be accompanied by Monsters and Minions.  At the beginning of the combat, players will draw 5 cards from their deck and if they have priority will play the first combat round. Each player may expend all their action points each turn, and action points are reset on each combat round. Cards will provided a detailed explanation of their effect and damage / defensive value. Some of these effects will be based on the state of combat, the cards available or combinations with other effects.  - <em>Resolving Damage:</em> Compare the damage being dealt to the Defence rating of the enemy, the enemy then takes damage equal the amount that exceeds this defence rating. Some enemies may have resistances or immunities to certain damage types.     - <em>Resistances</em> are added to the enemies Defence rating when taking damage from the associated type. Most attacks will only inflict a single damage type.   - <em>Immunities</em> as the name imply mean that the enemy will not take any damage from this damage type unless an effect otherwise states. - Stronger Monster's and Bosses can react with defensive abilities that may reduce or negate incoming damage. They will usually have a limited number of reactions available per turn. Players will be able to see these values and factor them into their strategy.  Once players have resolved their damage, the enemy will take their turn and repeat the damage resolution process against the players. Each player will have 1 reaction available to use a Defensive Card or Innate Ability. Some equipment may offer additional effects that can be used to bolster Defence further.  A cheat sheet for this will be provided later.  <strong><em>Running Combat:</em></strong>  The goal of combat, like any TTRPG is to continue the narrative and allow opportunities for players to roleplay their characters. As the DM you should encourage your players to describe their actions and keep their dialogue in character. As such, run combat with a goal in mind - perhaps a sub goal that must be achieved to ensure victory or save a friendly NPC. Play the enemies as real living beings with their own goals, intentions, and will to live.  <em>Examples:</em>  - A random encounter with a set of bandits will not likely fight to the last man and may attempt to flee when they see things are not going their way. They may plead for mercy or attempt to bribe the players. Your goal is to prevent combat from becoming a slog and detracting from the story telling.  - A Boss may have been in fact delaying the players while his master plan unfolds in the background. - Players are fighting in a burning building and must either defeat the enemies or escape before the building collapses. Use timers or limited combat rounds to create time pressure.  <strong><em>Combat Difficulty:</em></strong>   Combat Difficulty is often one of the most challenging parts of any TTRPG. Finding the balance between creating a sense of danger and outright lethal encounters can be difficult. It may be worth consulting your players for how difficult they want the game to be, and how dire the consequences of failure are.    <em>Here are some suggestions for managing difficulty:</em>  - Adapt to your players abilities - it's often best to start with a lower difficulty and scale it up as your players start to master their class. If they are crushing every combat with ease, this should be an obvious sign that your difficulty is too low -- whereas if they're struggling to survive every single combat then you may want to pull back a bit. - Dynamic Combat Scaling: While enemies may have a set deck and set of abilities, you as the DM can choose how aggressively to play them. If a combat is clearly getting out of hand for the players, you can hold back abilities as you see fit, and even reduce enemies HP if necessary. Your goal should not be TPK's every combat. - Enemies combat potency should be somewhat equivalent to their narrative placement. A random bandit might be a threat early on, but should stand no chance against a geared and levelled party. These distinctions should also be visible to players, allowing them to approach dangerous situations differently depending on the level of threat. In some cases, avoiding combat will be the best option. - Failing forward - Occasionally your party will falter in combat, whether they picked a fight too difficult or simply misplayed their cards. You as the DM should be prepared to offer alternative outcomes to combat that do not result in a party wipe. Bandits may be willing to spare lives for gold, it may be possible to flee from a creature, offering service or fealty to a enemy Boss may allow them to keep their lives (If they so choose). This does not mean removing the possibility of character death, but should be used as a means to continue the narrative.  <strong><em>Player Deaths & Party Wipes:</em></strong>   How you deal with player deaths and party wipes is entirely up to you as a DM. Will they be saved at the last moment by deus ex machina, or will their spirits be sent to a shadow realm? Will a players body be put in stasis until the possibility of resurrection? Or will your world be one of more mundane realities, and the dead stay dead. This should be part of your world building, and be planned for in the case of player deaths. Certainly removing the possibility of player death is not advisable, as it takes the danger out of the world -- but you don't want to torpedo your own campaign. Here are some ways you can handle character death:  - Offer the player a low penalty reroll, perhaps he can start at the same level but loses his equipment. Or he must complete a redemption quest to prove himself worth of joining the party. - If the player is heavily attached to that character, you can offer them a temporary side role while they attempt to resurrect their character. - On a party wipe, you could have them re-roll as a group of competing adventurers around the same level / equipment.  - Make the players fight their way out of a shadow / death realm and reclaim their physical forms.  Ultimately it's up to you and your players, so don't be afraid to consult them out of game. At the end of the day, they are here to be part of exploring the world and advancing YOUR story. So give them the tools they need to do so while getting maximum enjoyment out of being there. Some players enjoy the ruthless dangers of a lethal world, while others are more interested in the story telling and the ability to roleplay the ever victorious hero.  <strong><em>Advanced Combat Concepts:</em></strong>  <strong>Limited Round Combats:</strong> Giving the players a limited number of combat rounds to resolve an encounter can create a more interesting challenge. This could be imposed by a looming danger or the necessity to achieve a tertiary goal. Be sure to consider what happens when the time runs out, what outcomes are you okay with risking if they fail?  <em>Example:</em> The big bad guy has begun a summoning ritual that will take 10 rounds to complete. If the players do not defeat him in 10 rounds they will find themselves in a much more dire situation.   <strong>Combat Puzzles</strong>  A combat puzzle forces the players to attempt to achieve their desired outcome in a combat round by managing and collaborating with their fellow players. Some encounters could be a set of these puzzles, and can be used to great effect when in a particularly lethal situation.   <em>Example:</em> The players are fighting against a cult who's God is empowered by human sacrifice. Each round the players must attempt to stop as many of the cultists as possible from reaching the sacrificial altar that consumes their souls. After 3 rounds, the God will ascend and will have additional health for each cultist consumed.   <strong>Mitigating Factors</strong> You can give the players the opportunity to reduce the danger of an encounter, this can be done through strategic planning, assassinating leaders or simply poisoning the stew. This rewards players for approaching combat with a more pre meditated mindset.  <em>Examples:</em> <em>Example 1</em> - The players find out that the corrupt guard Captain is planning to ambush them and arrest them unlawfully. They also find out that his lieutenants are somewhat morally ambivalent towards the idea, and are possibly even opposed to it yet simply outranked. The players can attempt to avoid the ambush altogether, come in better prepared -- or attempt to sway the lieutenants into opposing the Captain in secret. This could create a scenario when they intentionally walk into the ambush and are able to turn it around and expose the treachery of the Captain.    <em>Example 2</em> - The players are planning to attack a vampire lord, and it is revealed that this lord draws his power from the souls of other vampires he's managed to enslave. These souls are being guarded at different locations throughout the world and could be destroyed to reduce the vampire lords power.  </p>","path":"public/compendium/Core Gameplay/Combat.md"},{"id":8,"name":"Damage Types","content":"<p>There are several major damage categories in the world, each with a subset of damage types.  <strong>Physical Damage</strong>  Physical damage is one of the most common damage types you'll find in the world.

The damage die from his Bow is D6 so he rolls 4D6 damage dice with a result of 14 Damage.      - He then rolls a Chance Dice since his Bow attacks can Critically Strike. He rolls a 62 so it is not a critical strike.    - Bandit#1 uses Scramble to try to mitigate the attack, his defence is calculated as:   - Defence Rating: 1 + 1 from Scramble, So he rolls 2D6 getting a result of 8. Bandit#1 therefore takes 6 damage, lowering his HP to 17 - <em>Maddy goes second:</em>   - Maddy plays Sunbeam(2) - A beam of intense Sunlight descends from the heavens, burning those in a radius of 15ft.

Bandit#1 - 2 are caught in the radius.     - Maddy uses Solar Flare to consume her remaining AP and add +1 SP to the attack    - Damage is calculated: 2 SP + 1 from Solar Flare. Maddy therefore rolls 3D8 with a result of 19    - Because the ability specifies 1/2 SP, the damage becomes 19 / 2 rounded up to 10.     - Bandit#1 - 2 roll 1d6 each from their Defence Rating, with respective result of 2 and 5.  - Bandit#1 therefore takes 8 Fire Damage and Bandit#2 takes 5 Fire damage, leaving them with 9 and 18 HP respectively. - <em>Bono goes third:</em>     - Bono uses 20ft of movement to get into melee range of Bandit#1    - Bono plays Lightning Strikes - You strike with blinding speed, your Basic Attacks only cost 1 AP until the end of the round.  - He then plays 2 Basic Attack cards    - Damage is then calculated: AP 2 = 2D6 x number of attacks     - Bono decides to use both attacks against Bandit#1 getting a total of 15 damage    - He then rolls a Chance die since his melee attacks can critically strike. He rolls a successful 96, landing a critical strike.    - Damage is increased to 30     - Bandit#1 rolls his 1D6 Defence getting a 5. He is therefore slain with heavy overkill damage.  - <em>Anny goes last:</em>    - Anny uses 25ft of movement to get into melee range of Bandit#3    - Anny plays Charging Strike(2) - Condition: You must have moved 10ft or more in a straight line this turn. You put the full inertia of your charge into your attack, knocking aside shields and tearing through enemy armour. Make a melee attack roll with +1 AP and 1 Armor Penetration. Enemies cannot the Raise Shield reaction against this attack.   - Anny then plays Shield Bash(1) - roll 1 AP, if it exceeds the enemies DR roll the enemy is knocked <em>prone</em>.   - Damage is then calculated: 2 AP + 1 from Charging Strike. Anny rolls 3D8  getting a result of 21 non critical.    - Though the Bandit has 1 DR, it is negated by the 1 Armour Penetration from Charging Attack.

Your class determines which cards you can add to your deck, and which equipment specializations you will have available. You can have a maximum of 2 classes, but some features may allow you limited use of other class cards. Due to the synergistic nature of cards, it is often disadvantageous to split your class too evenly -- usually pushing players to favour one class over the other for the majority of the campaign. That being said, there's no hard limits on how a player must divide their class cards, unless explicitly stated by a class feature.   Example Build:  A player has decided they would like to create a 'Paladin' deck, and chooses Weapon's Master and Priest as their base class. They therefore can pick any number of Priest or Weapon's Master cards when building their starting deck. Since they are looking to emulate a fantasy paladin, the deck should favour Weapon's Master cards and use Priest cards that don't require advanced synergies to be effective. The DM can help gently guide the deck creation process to ensure players have an enjoyable deck to play , but you can also feel free to give the players opportunities to retrofit their deck later on.   </p>","path":"public/compendium/Brainstorming/Concepts/Class Concepts.md"}]
