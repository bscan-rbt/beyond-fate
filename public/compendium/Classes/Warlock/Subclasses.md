*Demonic Enslavement* - The Warlock has studied the dark sorceries that allow him to enslave lesser demons and syphon their power. Demon's are manifestations of pure chaos energy and can allow the Warlock to call on the powers of the Abyss. From summoning Demonic forces to assaulting the minds of their enemies, Demonic Warlocks are masters of creating chaos and despair among their enemies.

***OR*** 

*Infernal Codex* - The Warlock has become adept in the Infernal tongue and can negotiate pacts with Devil's to gain Infernal powers.
