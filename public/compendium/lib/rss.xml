 <br>REWORKING FOR SIMPLICITY:<br>
<br>Base attributes will 1:1 represent combat power based on primary attributes. e.g.: 1 Strength = 1 Attack Power for a barbarian.
<br>Skills will have minimum stat requirements, or come with specific feats / items. These will be in no way directly derived from primary stats
<br>Hit points will still scale additionally on Stamina
<br>Tertiary attributes and critical strike will be gained purely through class feats and gear
<br>A large portion of feats will be locked behind primary stat requirements to maintain the flavour of each unique stat
<br><br>Strength - determines the characters physical strength and raw athletic ability. Directly increases attack power and may be required to equip certain Great Weapons.<br>Dexterity - determines the characters physical agility and reaction time. Can increase attack power with finesse weapons and critical strike chance.<br>Intellect - determines the players capability for wielding the raw forces of magic. Increases spell power and may be required to cast more powerful spells.<br>Faith - determines the strength of the players connection to divine beings. Increases spell power for faith based casters and allows characters to bind themself to more powerful beings.<br>Stamina - determines physical fitness and resilience to enemy attacks. Increases base health points, movement speed and may be required to wear heavier armor types. <br>Charisma - determines the players ability to influence other through deception, performance and persuasion. Also also increases spell power in healing magics and bolstering magics. <br>Values:<br>Each class has a modifier for how efficiently they use certain attributes. Simply multiply the attribute by this modifier to get your Secondary Attributes. Value's are always rounded up.<br>Example(s):<br>
The Elementalist class gains spell power from Intellect, with a class modifier of '.2'. So if the Elementalist has 15 Intellect, their spell power value will be 3. <br>The Weapon's Master class has a base modifier of '.2' for Stamina, but with the Sturdy feature this is increased to '.3'. So if the Weapon's Master has 12 Stamina, they will receive 4 HP per level. <br>Secondary Attributes:<br>
Secondary Attributes values are mostly inherited from Primary Attributes, but can be gained from certain equipment, consumables and spells.<br>Attack Power - The primary damage dealing attribute for physical damage dealers. The value determines the amount of dice rolled when dealing damage. The Damage Dice is determines by Class and equipment. Some attacks may specify a multiple of base attack power, such as half or double. Multiply the number of dice by this value and round up if necessary.<br>
Example: A Rogue with 11 Dexterity has 2 Attack Power, and is wielding a D6 Dagger. Therefore when an attack uses the Rogue's Attack Power, it would be rolled as 2D6. <br>Spell Power - The primary damage dealing attribute for spell casters. Functions in the same manner as Attack Power, though the damage Dice varies based on the caster.<br>
Example: Warlocks Damage Dice is determined by the power of their Patron, our Level 2 Warlock is currently using a Lesser Hellfire Demon with a D8 Dice. With 10 Intellect, and a Spell Power of 2, the Spell Power roll would be 2D8.<br>Hit Points - Hit points represent your characters physical and mental well being. Your character becomes Unconscious and gains the Dying trait when this value hits 0. Hit points are calculated by adding your modified Stamina value to your classes base HP.<br>
Example: A Druid with a base HP of 11, has 10 Stamina with a class modifier of '.3'. So at level 3 the Druid would have 23 HP.<br>Critical Strike - Critical Strike determines the chance of achieving a Critical Strike on an attack. Not all attacks or classes are capable of Critical Strikes. The value of this attribute is range that has to be rolled to achieve a Critical Strike.<br>
Example: A Rogue has a Critical Strike value of 7, so when rolling the D100 they need to roll a 93 or higher. <br>Defence Rating - Determines the number of Defence Dice rolled when called on by a Defensive Action. Works similarly to Attack Power and Spell Power.<br>
Example: A Range has a Defence Rating of 3 and is wearing Leather Armour with a D4 rating. When taking damage they would roll 3D4 to mitigate incoming damage.<br>Tertiary Attributes<br>
Tertiary Attributes are additional attributes most often gained from specialized equipment and class Features. These are highly limited but very powerful effects.<br>Armour Penetration - Bypass enemy armour, negating Defence Rating equal to the attribute value.<br>Hardened - Your hardened exterior reduces the Attack Power of incoming attacks, negating the value equal to the attribute rating.<br>Spell Penetration - Bypass enemy Resistances, negating Resistance to the associated damage type by the value of the attribute.<br>Resistant - You are resistant to the specified damage type, reduce Spell Power on spells of this damage type by the value of the attribute.<br>Skills<br>Skills are Innate Abilities that players can use to overcome various challenges in the world. These are determined by Base Attributes, Features and player choices.<br>
<br>Athletics (Strength) - Overcoming feats of physical strength such as a wrestling, lifting heavy objects and jumping.
<br>Acrobatics (Dexterity) - Overcoming feats of agility and quick reaction such as a navigating traps, dodging threats, and acrobatics.
<br>Persuasion (Charisma) - The character's ability to persuade the minds of other, can be used in business negotiations, interrogations and making allies.
<br>Arcana (Intelligence) - Used to gain understanding and overcoming challenges pertaining to magic. This could be magic puzzles, powerful objects, and determining enemy vulnerabilities.
<br>Deception (Charisma) - The character's ability to deceive others, such as lying about their intentions, misdirecting enemies and exaggerating.
<br>Nature (Faith) - The characters knowledge and affinity for nature and animals. Used to interact with animals, identify reagents and determine the vulnerabilities of beasts. 
<br>Intimidation (Charisma, Strength) - Used to convince others to do your bidding through fear. Can be used in interrogations, deterring enemies and haggling.
<br>Religion (Faith) - Used to recall knowledge and overcome challenges pertaining to religion and the occult. This could be solving Faith based puzzles, communing with divine beings or strengthening extraplanar bonds.
<br>Sleight of Hand (Dexterity)  - The characters ability to use their quick hands and dexterous cunning to overcome more illicit challenges. This includes lockpicking, theft, swapping objects and breaking and entering.
<br>Survival (Faith, Intelligence)- The characters knowledge and ability to navigate the wilds and sense danger. This can be used to detect traps, track enemies and look for the signs of an ambush.
<br>Stealth (Dexterity) - The characters ability to conceal themselves in the shadows and avoid enemy detection.
<br>Skills values are calculated by using the associated stat modifier + Skill Expertise:<br>
<br>Novice: +2
<br>Journeyman: +4
<br>Expert: +6
<br>Master: + 8
<br>Legend: +10

 <br>Players can pick up to two classes from which to build their character from the 9 base classes:<br>
<br>Alchemist - A master of alchemical concoctions, using their potent brews to deal massive damage and increase both defence and combat potency. Alchemists can also specialize in transfiguring materials to create new and exotic mixtures.
<br>Bard - Bard's weave the magic of music into their combat, bewitching the minds of enemies and bolstering their allies. 
<br>Druid - Druid's draw their power from nature and kinship with animals. Druid's can unleash this power to soothe their allies wounds and even take the form of a a bonded animal spirit.
<br>Elementalist - Elementalists channel the powers of the elements to cause devastating damage and restraining their enemies. They can specialize in single elements or weave together multiple elements to build intricate combos. 
<br>Priest - Priests use their divine connections to weave powerful healing magics or unleash pure terror on their enemies.
<br>Ranger - Rangers are versatile and cunning tacticians known for their prowess with ranged weapons. Rangers can use a range of traps and strategies to pick apart even the most stout of defences. 
<br>Rogue - Rogues are masters of the shadows and use lethal hit and run tactics to deal out massive damage. Their guile also extends to their exceptional sleight of hand and silver tongue.
<br>Warlock - Warlocks borrow power from their Demonic Patrons, usually enslaved by powerful binding magics but sometimes more sinister forces are at play. Depending on the Patron, warlocks can channel infernal powers, shadow magic and even summon demonic minions.
<br>After picking their class(es), players can define their characters race and history. See character sheet creator for specifics on each race and their attributes.<br>Attributes:<br>Strength - determines the characters physical strength and raw athletic ability. Directly increases attack power and may be required to equip certain Great Weapons.<br>Dexterity - determines the characters physical agility and reaction time. Can increase attack power with finesse weapons and critical strike chance.<br>Intellect - determines the players capability for wielding the raw forces of magic.

Increases base health points, movement speed and may be required to wear heavier armor types. <br>Charisma - determines the players ability to influence other through deception, performance and persuasion. Also also increases spell power in healing magics and bolstering magics. <br>Starting Deck<br>Players will receive a starting Class Deck with 20 base cards. If multi classing, players can exchange any number of these with cards from their secondary class. <br>Starting Equipment<br>
Based on your class and starting level, you can choose starting equipment to fit your playstyle.<br>
Equipment can increase defence, attack power, spell power and even increase attributes (though not likely for starting equipment)]]></description><link>core-gameplay/character-creation.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Core Gameplay/Character Creation.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 17:21:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Combat]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Updated ideas:<br>
<br>Damage always hits, but the effect may be mitigated
<br>Spell effects will have to overcome the enemies resistance, spells can be stacked to weaken this
<br>Armor negates damage up to its value per round,  armor penetration allows a portion of that armor to be ignored. Flanking attacks will reduce deal double damage to armor. e.g.: If a creature has 15 armor and an attack was rolled for 22 damage -- reduce the attack by 7 instead of 15
<br>Resistances function the same as armor, but for specific damage types. Resistances are not reduced by flanking
<br><br>
<br>Queue - Each player and the DM has a Queue which is where they play their Action, Reaction, Triggered Strategy, and Consumable Cards. Cards will be cleared from the Queue at the end of the combat round unless otherwise specified.
<br>Reserve - Each player and DM has a Reserve where persistent cards are played, such as Buffs / Debuffs, Strategy and Equipment Cards. Reserve Cards stay in play until their effects have expired or are moved to the Field.
<br>Pool - Pool represents the cards that players and the DM have in their hands. The standard Pool size is 5, and you will draw up to this number at the beginning of every combat round.
<br>Discard Pile - Most cards will go to the discard pile after their effect has expired unless otherwise specified. The discard pile will be shuffled when resetting your Deck.
<br>Out of Play - Some cards will have limited uses per Encounter, Rest, or Day. These cards are put Out of Play when their effects have expired. They can be shuffled back into the Deck when their cooldown has finished.
<br>Deck - Players and DM's have a Deck that holds all their available cards. When players reach the end of the deck, they will shuffle the Discard pile to reset it and gain 1 point of Exhaustion. For every two points of exhaustion, your Pool will be reduced by 1.
<br>Field - The field is the combat grid where player and enemy character tokens interact. The field is made up of a grid or hexagon tile pattern where each tile represents 5ft. Movement is always measured as 5ft, even when moving diagonally. When dealing with elevation during combat, to simplify math the distance is calculated as Horizontal Distance + 1/2 Vertical distance. Though it is recommended to avoid using this excessively, try to only emphasize this when vertically is a key part of the encounter.
<br>Action Points - Action Points are the core resource that allow players and enemies to use abilities and make attacks. Most classes have a base of 3 Action Points, these reset at the beginning of the Combat Round unless specified by an effect.
<br>Combat Round - The Combat Round is comprised of 2 phases: Player Turns and Enemy Turns. There is no set turn order between players, and they can plan out their moves strategically if necessary.
<br>Reactions - Players and most enemies will have access to Reactions that have certain triggers. These can be played directly from the player's Pool if available.
<br><br>Combat is what truly separates this from other TTRPG's, as it is centered around a deck building mechanic. Somewhat inspired by games like Slay the Spire, combat has not specific turn order and players can collaborate to enhance each others abilities. There is only two types of combat starts: Player Priority and Enemy Priority, this simply decides whether the players get round first or if the enemy does. This will be determined by the circumstances that lead to combat, and the players choices in how they approach dangerous situations. In combat, players will face three type of enemies: Monsters, Minions, and Bosses.<br>
<br>Monsters:  Any threat can be a monster, not only 'monstrous' creatures, the term is to simply codify the capabilities of an enemy. A Monster is a threatening entity that has a small card pool of abilities that will be added to the DM's hand during combat. They will also have innate abilities and equipment similar to Player Characters.
<br>Minions: Lesser threats that are represented by a single card. Often part of a Monster or Boss's card pool. Their attacks and defence will be stated on the card.
<br>Bosses: Bosses are the big bad enemies that your hero's will aspire to defeat. Offering a much greater challenge and reward than Monsters, a Boss may have a full deck of cards and be accompanied by Monsters and Minions.
<br>At the beginning of the combat, players will draw 5 cards from their deck and if they have priority will play the first combat round. Each player may expend all their action points each turn, and action points are reset on each combat round. Cards will provided a detailed explanation of their effect and damage / defensive value. Some of these effects will be based on the state of combat, the cards available or combinations with other effects.<br>
<br>Resolving Damage: Compare the damage being dealt to the Defence rating of the enemy, the enemy then takes damage equal the amount that exceeds this defence rating. Some enemies may have resistances or immunities to certain damage types.

<br>Resistances are added to the enemies Defence rating when taking damage from the associated type. Most attacks will only inflict a single damage type.
<br>Immunities as the name imply mean that the enemy will not take any damage from this damage type unless an effect otherwise states.


<br>Stronger Monster's and Bosses can react with defensive abilities that may reduce or negate incoming damage. They will usually have a limited number of reactions available per turn. Players will be able to see these values and factor them into their strategy.
<br>Once players have resolved their damage, the enemy will take their turn and repeat the damage resolution process against the players. Each player will have 1 reaction available to use a Defensive Card or Innate Ability. Some equipment may offer additional effects that can be used to bolster Defence further.<br>A cheat sheet for this will be provided later.<br>Running Combat:<br>The goal of combat, like any TTRPG is to continue the narrative and allow opportunities for players to roleplay their characters. As the DM you should encourage your players to describe their actions and keep their dialogue in character. As such, run combat with a goal in mind - perhaps a sub goal that must be achieved to ensure victory or save a friendly NPC. Play the enemies as real living beings with their own goals, intentions, and will to live.<br>Examples:<br>
<br>A random encounter with a set of bandits will not likely fight to the last man and may attempt to flee when they see things are not going their way. They may plead for mercy or attempt to bribe the players. Your goal is to prevent combat from becoming a slog and detracting from the story telling. 
<br>A Boss may have been in fact delaying the players while his master plan unfolds in the background.
<br>Players are fighting in a burning building and must either defeat the enemies or escape before the building collapses. Use timers or limited combat rounds to create time pressure.
<br>Combat Difficulty: <br>Combat Difficulty is often one of the most challenging parts of any TTRPG. Finding the balance between creating a sense of danger and outright lethal encounters can be difficult. It may be worth consulting your players for how difficult they want the game to be, and how dire the consequences of failure are.  <br>Here are some suggestions for managing difficulty:<br>
<br>Adapt to your players abilities - it's often best to start with a lower difficulty and scale it up as your players start to master their class. If they are crushing every combat with ease, this should be an obvious sign that your difficulty is too low -- whereas if they're struggling to survive every single combat then you may want to pull back a bit.
<br>Dynamic Combat Scaling: While enemies may have a set deck and set of abilities, you as the DM can choose how aggressively to play them. If a combat is clearly getting out of hand for the players, you can hold back abilities as you see fit, and even reduce enemies HP if necessary. Your goal should not be TPK's every combat.
<br>Enemies combat potency should be somewhat equivalent to their narrative placement. A random bandit might be a threat early on, but should stand no chance against a geared and levelled party. These distinctions should also be visible to players, allowing them to approach dangerous situations differently depending on the level of threat. In some cases, avoiding combat will be the best option.
<br>Failing forward - Occasionally your party will falter in combat, whether they picked a fight too difficult or simply misplayed their cards. You as the DM should be prepared to offer alternative outcomes to combat that do not result in a party wipe. Bandits may be willing to spare lives for gold, it may be possible to flee from a creature, offering service or fealty to a enemy Boss may allow them to keep their lives (If they so choose). This does not mean removing the possibility of character death, but should be used as a means to continue the narrative.
<br>Player Deaths &amp; Party Wipes:<br> How you deal with player deaths and party wipes is entirely up to you as a DM. Will they be saved at the last moment by deus ex machina, or will their spirits be sent to a shadow realm? Will a players body be put in stasis until the possibility of resurrection? Or will your world be one of more mundane realities, and the dead stay dead. This should be part of your world building, and be planned for in the case of player deaths. Certainly removing the possibility of player death is not advisable, as it takes the danger out of the world -- but you don't want to torpedo your own campaign. Here are some ways you can handle character death:<br>
<br>Offer the player a low penalty reroll, perhaps he can start at the same level but loses his equipment. Or he must complete a redemption quest to prove himself worth of joining the party.
<br>If the player is heavily attached to that character, you can offer them a temporary side role while they attempt to resurrect their character.
<br>On a party wipe, you could have them re-roll as a group of competing adventurers around the same level / equipment. 
<br>Make the players fight their way out of a shadow / death realm and reclaim their physical forms.
<br>Ultimately it's up to you and your players, so don't be afraid to consult them out of game. At the end of the day, they are here to be part of exploring the world and advancing YOUR story. So give them the tools they need to do so while getting maximum enjoyment out of being there. Some players enjoy the ruthless dangers of a lethal world, while others are more interested in the story telling and the ability to roleplay the ever victorious hero.<br>Advanced Combat Concepts:<br>Limited Round Combats:<br>
Giving the players a limited number of combat rounds to resolve an encounter can create a more interesting challenge. This could be imposed by a looming danger or the necessity to achieve a tertiary goal. Be sure to consider what happens when the time runs out, what outcomes are you okay with risking if they fail?<br>Example:<br>
The big bad guy has begun a summoning ritual that will take 10 rounds to complete. If the players do not defeat him in 10 rounds they will find themselves in a much more dire situation.<br>Combat Puzzles<br>A combat puzzle forces the players to attempt to achieve their desired outcome in a combat round by managing and collaborating with their fellow players. Some encounters could be a set of these puzzles, and can be used to great effect when in a particularly lethal situation. <br>Example:<br>
The players are fighting against a cult who's God is empowered by human sacrifice. Each round the players must attempt to stop as many of the cultists as possible from reaching the sacrificial altar that consumes their souls. After 3 rounds, the God will ascend and will have additional health for each cultist consumed. <br>Mitigating Factors<br>
You can give the players the opportunity to reduce the danger of an encounter, this can be done through strategic planning, assassinating leaders or simply poisoning the stew. This rewards players for approaching combat with a more pre meditated mindset.<br>Examples:<br>
Example 1 - The players find out that the corrupt guard Captain is planning to ambush them and arrest them unlawfully. They also find out that his lieutenants are somewhat morally ambivalent towards the idea, and are possibly even opposed to it yet simply outranked. The players can attempt to avoid the ambush altogether, come in better prepared -- or attempt to sway the lieutenants into opposing the Captain in secret. This could create a scenario when they intentionally walk into the ambush and are able to turn it around and expose the treachery of the Captain.  <br>Example 2 - The players are planning to attack a vampire lord, and it is revealed that this lord draws his power from the souls of other vampires he's managed to enslave. These souls are being guarded at different locations throughout the world and could be destroyed to reduce the vampire lords power.]]></description><link>core-gameplay/combat.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Core Gameplay/Combat.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 12:36:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Damage Types]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Decks are the core of the gameplay experience, and are a collection of cards offering a variety of combat effects. There are 4 main types of cards: Actions, Items, Consumables, and Strategy.<br>
<br>Action - Action cards represent actions that the players characters can take during combat. These include attacks, defensive reactions, spells and buffs. Action spells will have a action point cost and are discarded after use unless otherwise specified by an effect. 

<br>Each class receives a set of 'Basic' Action cards for simple melee attacks and defensive actions.
<br>Additional cards are selected on level up, or can be received as rewards for encounters, purchased from trainers and even found in the world.


<br>Items - Item cards are usable items that can be purchased or found and added to a players deck. Item cards may have certain class requirements to play. Items stay on the playing field until destroyed or consumed by their effect. Some items can be repaired if destroyed, this will be specified on the card.
<br>Consumables - Consumables or limited use cards that are held separately from your main hand. This includes things such as potions, scrolls and throwables. 
<br>Strategies - Strategy cards are class specific cards that have context specific effects. They are played face down and activated only when the conditions are met. Players can show these to their team mates but keep the effect hidden from the DM. Some strategy cards may require all the players to work towards a shared goal.
<br><br>When players create their character they will receive a base starting deck from their selected class that has 20 cards. If they are multi-classing, they can exchange any number of starting cards with cards from their secondary class's starting deck.<br>Each time the player levels up they can add 2 cards from their Class Level Up Deck. These can be split between multiple classes if multi-classing.<br>Powerful enemies, vendors and sometimes unique locations can offer powerful and unique cards.<br>Players may have cards that are not currently usable or in use, these can be added to their Collection. After a long rest, players can exchange cards from their Collection with those in their Deck while preparing for the day.<br><br>While there are no level requirements on cards, some cards will have requirements to be used or played. Some are tied to class, attribute values or weapon specializations. Players can keep cards for later use in their Collection.<br><br>All classes have a base capacity of 3 consumables with the exception of Alchemist that starts with 5. This repertoire can be expanded with certain items and class features. Consumables can be stored in the players collection, and swapped during daily preparations. While they are not part of the Players Deck, they still may require action points. <br><br>Strategy cards are rare and powerful cards that allow the party to set up for powerful effects by completing the listed conditions.

 <br>Exploration will play in a very similar fashion to other TTRPG's. The DM will guide the players and weave the narrative as they see fit. Players can use their classes 'Innate Abilities' to interact with and influence the world around them in the same way you might see in Dungeon's &amp; Dragons. That being said, the DM does have a few tools in their chest that can utilize the RNG and Card mechanics of the game. The Random Events deck allows the DM to add an element of randomness, flesh out a traversal sequence, or simply create an element of unpredictability in a dungeon. This deck can be tailored to the zone or simply be a collection of scripted events and encounters.<br>Non Combat Encounters - Players have access to Innate Abilities that allow them to navigate out of combat situations using Dice rolls to determine outcomes. Social interactions can be roleplayed like any other TTRPG and puzzles can be overcome using magic and feats of strength. Using your Combat Deck's cards in social situations will often be received with hostility, if not direct retaliation.]]></description><link>core-gameplay/exploring-the-world.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Core Gameplay/Exploring the World.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2025 19:20:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Summary]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>To build a simple but more engaging combat system for tabletop RPG's using cards to represent action economy. To maintain a semblance of RPG progression on top of deck building mechanics as well as traditional positional elements of combat.<br><br>Much of the core gameplay will feel familiar to TTRPG players, especially of common games like D&amp;D and Pathfinder. The main differences will be in the combat system, where traditional TTRPG combat will be supplemented by cards that represent a players action economy. <br><br>Myself and many people I have played with find the save or suck and repetitive nature of TTRPG combat can bog down games and take away the enjoyment from the greater scope of the game. Cards allow for more interesting spell interactions that may break balance in traditional combat, as well as the slot machine effect of drawing the perfect situational card. They also provide a constant route for player progression that is not tied purely to stat or gear upgrades.<br><br>The first step is to extract what I feel to be essential parts of traditional TTRPG's and maintain the core roleplaying and progression. Then to reimagine the classes so that each deck has a clear identity, but leaves room for player experimentation like a proper deck builder. I believe that part of the key to achieving this is to maintain some of the standard character progression from TTRPGs, such as stat scaling and gearing. This means keeping very tight damage numbers and scalable math that won't become an overhead for players and DM's.]]></description><link>core-gameplay/summary.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Core Gameplay/Summary.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 12:09:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Religions & Gods]]></title><description><![CDATA[
